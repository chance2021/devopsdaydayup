# Design Document: CI/CD Workflow and Configuration for Multi-Environment Deployment

**Introduction**

This document outlines the design and configuration for a CI/CD pipeline workflow supporting four environments: dev, qa, staging, and prod. It is built around best practices, ensuring code quality, security, and deployment efficiency. The environments are integrated with Azure Functions and utilize Docker containers for deployment.

---
## Workflow Overview

### 1. Branching Strategy
- **Feature Branch**: Developers create a `feature/<TICKET NUMBER>` branch from the `develop` branch to work on new features.
- **Develop Branch**: `develop` branch represents the latest development code. All changes from feature branches are merged here after CI passes.
- **Release Branch**: `releases/<RELEASE DAYTE>` Created by the SRE team after QA sign-off, representing code ready for staging and production.
- **Main Branch**: `main` branch represents the stable production codebase.

## CI/CD Workflow

### 1. DEV Workflow

Trigger: Code pushed to `feature` or `develop` branches.

#### Feature Branch CI:
Steps:
1.	Run unit tests.
2.	Build Docker image.
3.	Publish results to the CI dashboard (e.g., test coverage, build logs).

Outcome: Validates the feature branch for integration.

#### Develop Branch CI:
Steps:
1.	Run unit tests.
2.	Build Docker image and push to the image registry (tagged as dev-latest).
3.	Run security scans (e.g., Snyk, Trivy).
4.	Deploy to dev environment (Azure Function).
5.	Notify developers on successful deployment.

Outcome: Validates merged code and deploys to the dev environment.

### 2. QA Workflow

Trigger: QA triggers the pipeline manually after dev sign-off.

Steps:
1.	Copy the latest dev image and tag it as qa-latest.
2.	Deploy the image to the qa environment (Azure Function).
3.	Notify QA team for testing.

Outcome: Ensures code readiness for staging.

### 3. Staging Workflow

Trigger: Release branch creation by the SRE team and trigger the pipeline manually.

Steps:
1.	Run unit tests, integration tests, and code scans.
2.	Build Docker image and tag it with a release date (e.g., release-YYYYMMDD).
3.	Run image security scans.
4.	Push the image to the staging registry.
5.	Deploy to the staging environment (Azure Function).

Outcome: Validates the release in a staging environment.

### 4. Production Workflow

Trigger: Manual approval during the release window.

Steps:
1.	Copy the image from staging to the prod registry.
2.	Pause for manual approval.
3.	Deploy the image to the prod environment (Azure Function).

Outcome: Ensures controlled and stable production deployment.

## CI/CD Pipeline Configuration

### Pipeline Structure

Environment	Trigger	CI Steps	CD Steps
Dev	Push to develop	Unit tests, security scans, Docker build, push to registry (dev)	Deploy to dev environment
QA	Manual trigger	Copy dev image to qa, tag as qa-latest	Deploy to qa environment
Staging	Release branch	Unit tests, integration tests, security scans, Docker build, push to staging registry	Deploy to staging environment
Prod	Manual approval	Copy staging image to prod, tag as prod-latest	Deploy to prod environment during release window

Best Practices

1. Code Quality and Security
	•	Use tools like SonarQube for code analysis.
	•	Run container image scans using Trivy or Aqua Security.
	•	Implement mandatory peer reviews before merging.

2. Deployment Standards
	•	Automate environment-specific configurations using Helm or similar tools.
	•	Use environment variables for sensitive data, managed via Azure Key Vault.

3. Reliability
	•	Utilize blue-green deployments for staging and production to minimize downtime.
	•	Log all pipeline activities for auditing.

4. Notifications
	•	Integrate notifications with Slack or Teams for status updates.

Technical Implementation

1. GitHub Actions
	•	Define workflows for each branch trigger.
	•	Example YAML for develop CI/CD:

name: CI/CD Pipeline

on:
  push:
    branches:
      - develop

jobs:
  build-test-deploy:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    steps:
      - name: Checkout code
        uses: actions/checkout@v3

      - name: Run unit tests
        run: ./run-tests.sh

      - name: Build Docker image
        run: docker build -t myapp:${{ github.sha }} .

      - name: Push Docker image to registry
        run: docker push myregistry.azurecr.io/myapp:${{ github.sha }}

      - name: Deploy to Azure Function
        run: az functionapp deployment source config-zip --name my-dev-function \
             --resource-group my-resource-group --src-path path/to/artifact.zip

2. Artifact Management
	•	Use Azure Container Registry (ACR) for image storage.
	•	Tag images with meaningful names (e.g., dev-latest, release-YYYYMMDD).

3. Testing Framework
	•	Unit testing with JUnit.
	•	Integration testing using Postman or Cypress.

Diagram: CI/CD Workflow

Feature Branch (Developer)
      ↓
Develop Branch → CI for Develop → Deploy to Dev Environment
      ↓
QA Pipeline (Trigger) → Deploy to QA Environment
      ↓
Release Branch → CI for Release → Deploy to Staging Environment
      ↓
Production Approval → Deploy to Prod Environment

Conclusion

This CI/CD workflow ensures:
	1.	Streamlined development and testing processes.
	2.	Secure and stable deployments across environments.
	3.	Best practices and tools for code quality, security, and performance.
